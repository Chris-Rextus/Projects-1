Objetive: Input a determined interest rate for a given application, the invested amount and the time interval for such application; Then, compute the revenue for such
parameters using composed interest rates not just for the given determined interest rate, but for the next four values of it (incrementing in 1% each) on each year;
Finally, it displays all of them in a datasheet for easy comparing between values and revenues. 

WARNING: The range for the incrementing interest rate in the final display is not able to be changed. Changing it's MACRO at the MACRO defining will break the code.
WARNING: All inputted interest rates are supposed to be positive, i.e, gains. Inputting losses, negative rates will break the code aswell.
WARNING: All variables were set as doubles for avoiding type problems or arithmetic overflow.
